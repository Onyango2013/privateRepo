You recently were given $100,000. Instead of spending it, you'd like to invest it in a company with the hopes of getting a return on your investment.

Find a company you'd be interested to invest in. Research this company and explain why you chose it for investment.

Submit a 6 to 8 page report explaining your investment decision and citing your research using APA style.

As part of your report, be sure to calculate some key financial ratios to assess whether or not it is a good investment. Include your calculations and explain why you relied on those specific 
ratios to assess whether or not to invest in that company.
