### Before we can work with ArcGIS we need to import the arcpy module
### it's really easy

import arcpy

### We can also go ahead and set a workspace and turn overwriting on

arcpy.env.workspace = "C:" ### specify a folder to put your work in here.

### you generally won't need to include the full path to objects placed
### in the workspace, Python will look here for them.

arcpy.env.overwriteOutput = True

### Let's say we are working with a shapefile called Cities.shp

### Define the object we are working with
cities = "Cities.shp" ### Notice I don't use the whole path if the file is in the workspace

### Finds city names and coordinates
with arcpy.da.UpdateCursor(cities, ["NAME", "X_CO", "Y_CO" "SHAPE@X", "SHAPE@Y"]) as cursor:
    for row in cursor:
        NAME = row[0]
        x = row[4]
        y = row[5]


### Here we have opened an update cursor to find data inside cities
### This lets us read and write data to this file
### "NAME", "X_CO", and "Y_CO" are names of a fields containing city names
### and blank fields.        
### SHAPE@X and SHAPE@Y are commands to retrieve the X and Y data for each city
### We have then saved the data to a variable
### Let's populate the X_CO and Y_CO fields with X Y data.

        row[1] = x
        row[2] = y
        cursor.updateRow(row)


### Always remember to delete cursors when you are finished with them
del cursor

### There are multipe types of cursors, familiarize yourself with them
### to be sure you use the best one for each situation.
